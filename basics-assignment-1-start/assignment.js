//     your choice) and one that holds no value initially (e.g. "result").

const fictionalNumber = 10;

//     Set the result variable to 18 plus the value stored in user input.

result = fictionalNumber + 18;

//     Add three additional lines of code where you change the result variable
//     again (by subtracting a value of your choice, multiplying it and
//     dividing it).

//     Think about the value stored in the user input variable you also created
//     - did that value change?
//      No

//     <code>alert()</code> the result and the user input variables (in two
//     separate <code>alert()</code> calls).
